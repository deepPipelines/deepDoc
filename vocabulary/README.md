# Collection of controlled vocabulary

Collection of terms to be used throughout all DEEP pipelines.
Each term should be annotated with a source ("team" if no official source)

Please keep the TSV file in alphabetical order.

Terms that are listed as not required do not need to be manually annotated 
in the sample annotation of pipeline configuration file. These entries will
be derived as part of the pipeline itself (example: fragment length will 
be estimated by the pipeline).
